			<w:Heading level="2" summary="docSummary">Documentation</w:Heading>
			<p>We're continuing our efforts to complete and correct the documentation. 
			As you may have noticed we are not native english speakers, so any help in correcting typos is welcome. </p>
			<p>Due to the non quality of the actual javadoc, we voluntarily withdrew it from the sources. 
				We will provide the necessary efforts to deliver a good Javadoc in next releases.</p>
				
				
			
				
			<w:Heading level="2" summary="docSummary">Components</w:Heading>
			<p>We will keep on our efforts to provide rich components. 
				We know that some important components are missing, such as the followings and for sure many others are required. 
				Any other suggestions are welcome and will be discussed.
			</p>
				
			<w:Heading level="3" summary="docSummary">Drag and Drop support</w:Heading>
			<p>We're going to provide  an easy  drag and drop support. We don't know how yet, but we will find a solution.</p>
			
			<w:Heading level="3" summary="docSummary">Template logic</w:Heading>
			<p>Based on data binding, the template logic will help to make easily dynamic forms.
				All needs hasn't been fixed, but we're  thinking about it.
			</p>

</l:ConditionEquals>
...	
]]></pre>
				</c:StaticCode>
			</div>
	
			<w:Heading level="2" summary="docSummary">New plugins</w:Heading>
			<p>Those plugin's are ideas of what we'll maybe need a close day.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Social plugins :</strong> Make easy the integration with the most common social networks.</li>
				<li><strong>MarkDown / RichText editor :</strong> Make easy to write and read markdown text.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<w:Heading level="2" summary="docSummary">Conclusions</w:Heading>
			<p>Yes there are still months of works. Implementing new features, fixing bugs.
				But we're pretty sure that PWT will help you tomorrow to build great web apps, it already helps us every days.
