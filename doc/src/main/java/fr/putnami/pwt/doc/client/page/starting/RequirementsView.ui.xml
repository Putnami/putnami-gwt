		<ul>
			<li>Latest version of <abbr title="Google Web Toolkit">GWT</abbr> (currently @gwtVersion@)</li>
			<li>Guava and Guava-gwt version @guavaVersion@</li>
			<li>Latest version of Twitter's Bootstrap Css file (currently 3.1.1) (Note : We do not use the Javascript files, all is natively developped in <abbr title="Google Web Toolkit">GWT</abbr>)</li>
